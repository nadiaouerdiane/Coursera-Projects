# Coursera-Projects
This is a set of guided projects I created using the Rhythm platform on Coursera along with the instructor.
My goal is to apply what I have learned and put it into practice and to enhance my programming skills in Python.
I found this the most practical and effective way to easily learn Python (and any other programming language) and I highly recommend these guided projects to anyone aspiring to learn Python very quickly.
This is the most enjoyable and constructive way to learn.
